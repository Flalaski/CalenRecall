# Cherokee Calendar Expert Consultation Questions

**Date**: December 2024  
**Purpose**: Questions for Cherokee cultural experts regarding calendar implementation

## Background

Our implementation maps Cherokee month names to the Gregorian calendar structure (12 months), which reflects a 19th-century historical adaptation. We want to ensure this representation is:

1. **Historically accurate** - Correctly reflects how the calendar was adapted
2. **Culturally respectful** - Appropriate representation of Cherokee traditions
3. **Educationally valuable** - Provides accurate cultural information

## Questions for Cultural Experts

### 1. Historical Accuracy

**Q1.1**: Is our understanding correct that the Cherokee calendar was historically adapted in the 19th century to align with the 12-month Gregorian structure?

**Q1.2**: Are the month name mappings we're using historically accurate? Specifically:
- Do the month names correctly correspond to the Gregorian months?
- Were these mappings established during the adaptation period?

**Q1.3**: What historical sources should we reference to verify the accuracy of month name mappings?

### 2. Traditional Calendar System

**Q2.1**: What did the traditional Cherokee calendar system look like before the 19th-century adaptation?
- Was it lunar-based?
- How many months/cycles did it have?
- How did it align with seasons?

**Q2.2**: Should we include information about the traditional calendar system in our implementation or documentation?

**Q2.3**: Are there any traditional calendar elements that should be preserved or highlighted?

### 3. Month Names and Translations

**Q3.1**: Are the Cherokee month names we're using spelled correctly?
- Should we use Cherokee syllabary (ᎠᏂᏴᏫᏯᎢ) in addition to transliteration?
- Are there alternative spellings or names we should know about?

**Q3.2**: What do each of the month names mean or represent?
- Are there cultural associations we should document?

**Q3.3**: Are there variations in month names between different Cherokee communities or dialects?

### 4. Cultural Appropriateness

**Q4.1**: Is representing the Cherokee calendar as a Gregorian adaptation appropriate, or should we present it differently?

**Q4.2**: How should we handle the fact that this is an adaptation rather than the original traditional calendar?

**Q4.3**: Are there any cultural sensitivities we should be aware of in how we present this calendar?

### 5. Preferred Representation

**Q5.1**: How would you prefer the Cherokee calendar to be represented in our application?
- As a 12-month adaptation (current approach)?
- With additional context about traditional calendar?
- In a different format?

**Q5.2**: What contextual information should we include to help users understand:
- The historical adaptation
- The traditional calendar system
- Cultural significance

**Q5.3**: Should we include disclaimers or explanatory notes about the calendar's nature as an adaptation?

### 6. Additional Considerations

**Q6.1**: Are there any Cherokee calendar-related resources (books, websites, organizations) you would recommend for verification?

**Q6.2**: Are there specific Cherokee cultural organizations we should contact for verification?

**Q6.3**: Would you be willing to review our implementation and provide feedback?
